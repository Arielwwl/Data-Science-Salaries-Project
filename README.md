# Data-Science-Salaries-Project
Our Data Associate Program focuses on analyzing trends in the tech industry using the Data Science Salaries Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023) for our analysis. This project examines how salaries have evolved across job roles such as Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and NLP Engineers from 2020 to 2023. Through this project, we will explore salary growth patterns, identify high-demand roles, and understand how factors like experience level, job group, and remote work influence salaries. By combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques such as Regression for salary prediction and Supervised Learning Models for salary and role prediction, the project aims to equip us with hands-on experience in analyzing market trends and applying machine learning to solve real-world problems. This project is designed to provide valuable insights into the evolving tech industry while preparing participants for future roles in analytics and data science.
